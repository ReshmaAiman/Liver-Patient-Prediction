# Liver-Patient-Prediction
### Creating a predictive model with implementation of different classifier on Liver Patient dataset to predict the liver diseases.
### For EDA performed the Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate analysis.
### After preprocessing, confirmed that there is no high correlation between each columns.
### After noticed that the data is imbalanced, tried with oversampling and tried checking with different models to get the best model.
### Random Forest - training accuracy -> 100% and testing accuracy -> 82%
### Decision Tree - training accuracy -> 95% and testing accuracy -> 77%
### SVM - training accuracy -> 100% and testing accuracy -> 92%
### Logistic Regression - training accuracy -> 71% and testing accuracy -> 75%
### We notice that SVM gives the best results.
